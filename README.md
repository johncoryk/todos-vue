# todos-vue

## My very first Vue app!

This is my first humble attempt at creating something with Vue! I'm primarily a React developer and spend most of my time in that ecosystem, but this is me trying to branch out and see another point of view... well vue ðŸ˜‰.

## What I learned

I won't drag on about every detail on how Vue is different from React or other frameworks, but in short, Vue gives away A LOT for free! It feels more like a 'framework' as opposed to how React just felt like I was writing vanilla javascript at times. Vue is also a bit nostalgic in a way, I found myself working with html in a way that took me back to building simple html/css static sites. I'm exited to continue to learn and to continue the next 100 days + with Vue!

If you'd like to follow along, I've started using the hashtag #100DaysOfVue on [Twitter](https://twitter.com "Twitter's Homepage")!
